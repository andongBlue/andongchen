I am now a graduate student in NLP direction. I graduated from [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/) with an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation. My supervisor was Prof. [Zhigang Ling](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1307/4568.htm) who start my research journey about Artificial Intelligence. Now I am doing my master's degree in China and National Language Resource and Monitoring Research Center at Minzu University of China and [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), supervised by Prof. Xiaobing Zhao, Prof. Yuan Sun and PHD [Rosella Galindo Esparza](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oxqjNj8AAAAJ&hl=en). During this period, I spent summer doing intership in industry. Recently I am working on large-scale pre-training model in the AI Lab in Cambricon Technologies Corporation, supervised by Prof. [Xishan Zhang](http://people.ucas.edu.cn/~zhangxishan?language=en). In the process of programming, I like to open source what I think is valuable. Now I am the project leader of an open source project about data analysis([Hands-on data analysis](https://github.com/datawhalechina/hands-on-data-analysis/blob/master/README-English.md)), which now has **398 starts** and **163 forks**.
# Recent progressðŸ’¡
