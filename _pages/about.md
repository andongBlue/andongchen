I graduated from [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/) with an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation. My supervisor was Prof. [Zhigang Ling](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1307/4568.htm) who start my research journey about Artificial Intelligence.

In China (2019/09-2020/01; 2022/02-2022/06), I researched on low resources language at China and National Language Resource and Monitoring Research Center in Minzu University of China, advised by  Prof. Xiaobing Zhao and  Prof. Yuan Sun. In the UK ( 2021/02-2022/01), My major is Big Data Science at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/). During my stay in the UK, I am doing research on machine reading comprehension at [Computational Linguistics Lab](http://compling.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), advised by Ph.D. candidate [Rosella Galindo Esparza](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oxqjNj8AAAAJ&hl=en).

Recently I am working on generative pre-trained language model at [ICT](http://english.ict.cas.cn/)(Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences), supervised by Prof. [Xishan Zhang](http://people.ucas.edu.cn/~zhangxishan?language=en). 

In open-source contributions, I like to open source what I think is valuable. Now I am the project leader of an open source project about data analysis([Hands-on data analysis](https://github.com/datawhalechina/hands-on-data-analysis/blob/master/README-English.md)), which now has **400 starts** and **163 forks**.

# Recent progressðŸ’¡

1. Recently, I am working as a NLP Research Intern  at [ICT](http://english.ict.cas.cn/)(Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences), mainly working on **generative pre-trained language model**.
2. In collaboration with [Rosella Galindo Esparza](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oxqjNj8AAAAJ&hl=en) in [Queen Mary University of London](http://compling.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), a paper is being written on **low-resource machine reading comprehension**. The paper will be submitted to **ACL**.

# Misc.
I hiked 30.8 kilometers of the [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road) in the summer after College Entrance Examination. I like the feeling of slowly moving forward and seeing the scenery along the way, and looking back to see how far I have moved forward. During college I enjoyed making friends and interacting with all differnet kinds of people. Communication has become a way for me to relax. I also like to communicate when I am alone, reading books and watching movies are the most common things I do.

For sports, I like swimming and badminton. I am recently learning cue sports.
