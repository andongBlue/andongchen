excerpt: 'In this paper, aiming at scarcity of Tibetan knowledge graphs, we extend the Tibetan knowledge graph by using the triples of the high- resource language knowledge graphs and POI (Point of Information) map information. To improve the represen -tation learning of the Tibetan knowledge graph, we propose a joint model to merge structure and entity description information based on the TransE and CNN model. '
